# Wifite2UI
A GUI for wifite2 specifically for "smart" phone use.

YMMV, I'm focused on getting this going for my PinePhone. 

Don't get me wrong, I really prefer the command line over these kinds of dumbed down GUIs, however on a smart phone that's not really doable and a lot slower than having a prepped specialized app to help manage the command line arguments.

Remember Watch_Dogs? Could you imagine how much more difficult those feats would be if a command line was used? This is my first foray into creating somethign akin to that, so it seemed wifi screwery was a good place to start.
